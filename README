INSTALLATION

For installation, do the following:

	1. Read and edit the csh script, install_mif.
	2. Run install_mif.

You might have to run the script as root.

    Note:
	The Perl programs might need the first line editted to point
	to the location of the Perl interpreter at your site.  By 
	default, the programs assume /usr/local/bin/perl.

See NOTES below for further information.

DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is located in the directory doc/.  The documentation is in
FrameMaker 4.0 and HTML.  Reading the files in doc/ should get you
started on how to the programs.

** All the mif.pl extension libraries still need to be documented. **

Files with just the ".doc" extension are in Frame 4.0.  The ".doc.html"
files are the Frame files converted to HTML.

I put considerable time in documenting the tools, so pleeeease read
them :-)

If you have a Web client like Mosaic, you can load the HTML files into
the viewer for reading.  The HTML files contain cross-references (that
hopefully help in describing things) to each other.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES

 o  The Perl programs make use of the file "mif.pl" and other libraries
    in the mif/ directory.  The installation script trys to install the
    files in a standard Perl library location in a sub-directory called
    "mif".  However, if you install it in a location that Perl does not
    look for when requiring files, then make sure you set the PERLLIB
    environment variable.

 o  The HPTagEDC/ directory contains the HTML conversion of the HPTag
    Element Catalog.  This is the Frame quivalent to the OpenBook DTD.
    The file "files/HPTagEDC.desc" is the element description file used
    for the HPTag Element Catalog.  See documentation on edc2html for
    more information on element description files.

 o  mif.pl is the guts of everything.  I tried to write it so it can be
    used in any Perl program dealing with Frame MIF.  All the other
    mif_*.pl libraries just hook in callbacks into mif.pl to do their
    job.
    
    If you come up with a nifty program that uses mif.pl, please drop
    me a message.  I'd like to see if others are making any use of it.
